## Project Title

### Smart Utilities Management System

The Smart Utilities Management System aims to modernize how utility companies manage and understand gas, water, and electricity consumption through a centralized digital platform. As urban environments expand and demand for resources increases, utility companies require modern digital solutions that can scale, adapt, and provide real-time insights. This application was born from the motivation to bridge the gap between raw utility data and actionable intelligence, enabling companies to better understand consumption behavior, reduce waste, and enhance service quality. It reflects a strong desire to innovate within the utilities sector through technology and sustainable resource management to supporting data-driven decision-making. This project is full-stack web application developed with Java Spring Boot. [Link to Backend APIs](https://github.com/FrotaLucas/smart-utilities-apis)

## 2. Architecture

### REST API Architecture

The application adheres to REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### Key Characteristics of REST:

**1. Statelessness**: Each request from the client must contain all the information needed to process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests, enhancing scalability and reliability.

**2. Client-Server Architecture**: Separates the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, allowing the client and server to evolve independently.

**3. Uniform Interface**: Defines a standardized way of communicating between client and server. Standard URIs for Resource Identification, a consistent representation of messages (such as JSON or XML), and the use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) according to RESTful principles ensure a uniform and scalable API design.

**4. Layered System**:  RESTful arquitecture are built in hierarchical layers, allowing components to operate independently. Client → Proxy or Cache → Load Balancer → Backend Server.

**5. Cacheability**: The server can indicate whether a response is cacheable by the browser (e.g., using headers like Cache-Control: max-age=3600 or Expires: [date]). This allows the browser to retrieve data from the cache, reducing latency and improving performance.

### Technologies Used

#### Backend
- **Framework**:The backend of this project is built using Java Spring Boot for developing RESTful APIs. Maven is used for dependency management and project execution, ensuring a standardized and efficient build process. The application integrates with Microsoft SQL Server as its relational database, using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for object-relational mapping and database interaction. Database schema updates are managed automatically through Hibernate, streamlining development and evolution of the data model.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  

#### Database
- **System**: SQL Server

#### Tools
- **API Testing**: Postman  
- **Version Control**: Git  

## 3. Software Setup & Usage

### Technology Roles

- **SQL Server**: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft, used to store, manage, and query application data.

- **Apache Maven 3.9.9**: A build automation tool primarily for Java projects, managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.

- **Java HotSpot™ 21.0**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation used to run Java applications.

- **Postman**: An API client used for testing and documenting APIs.

- **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight but powerful source code editor, ideal for frontend development.

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development.

- **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.


## 4. UML Diagram & Database Schema

Notes:
Relationship
1. Relationship: One-to-Many (One Customer can have multiple Readings).
2. Key caractheristics of Entitieas: optional to optional. 
> *Note: customer can exist without being linked to reading and reading can have its customer_id set to null* <
